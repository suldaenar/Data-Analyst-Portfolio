Hello, my name is Hana V.

I want to change my career to a data analyst and I would like to use this portfolio to show what I can do.



My skills are:

SQL - Basics, Joining Tables, Aggregations, Subqueries, CTE, Window Functions, User Defined Functions, Stored Procedures, etc.

PowerBI - Data Modelling, Data Transformation in Power Query, Basic DAX formulas and Interactive Reports

Python - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn + starting with Spark and Plotly/Dash (and some other libraries and packeges)


Microsoft Excel - using Excel for Office 365, basics formulas and functions including Dynamic Array formulas, creating dashboards 


To begin with, I uploaded the NY Housing project, where I cleaned the dataset using Python and prepared it for further analysis.
Other projects will be added soon.
