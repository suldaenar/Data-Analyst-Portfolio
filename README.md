Hello, my name is Hana V.

I want to change my career to a data engineer/analyst and I would like to use this portfolio to show what I can do.


My skills:

-  SQL - Basics, Joining Tables, Aggregations, Subqueries, CTE, Window Functions, User Defined Functions, Stored Procedures, etc.
-  PowerBI - Data Modelling, Data Transformation in Power Query, Basic DAX formulas and Interactive Reports
-  Python - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn + starting with Spark and Plotly/Dash (and some other libraries and packages)
-  Microsoft Excel - using Excel for Office 365, basics formulas and functions including Dynamic Array formulas, creating dashboards 

To begin with, I uploaded the NY Housing project, where I cleaned the dataset using Python and prepared it for further analysis. The data source is kaggle.com.

Power BI report:

Filter map page of real estate properties with slicers to find a property by:
-  price,
-  price per sqft,
-  county-city-street hierarchy,
-  type,
-  count of bedrooms,
-  count of bathrooms.

In the map there is a tooltip for each bubble with address and other important facts. 

Statistics page contains some charts:
-  top 5 brokers by count of properties,
-  top 5 streets by average price per sqft,
-  comparison of average price and average price per sqft in counties,
-  percent share of housing types.

Some charts are connected so you can display f.e. most expensive streets in specific county etc.

Other projects will be added soon.
